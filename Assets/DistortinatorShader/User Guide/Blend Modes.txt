The blend mode is set separately for source and destination, 
it controls the blend factor of each component going into the blend equation. 
Note: the blend modes are ignored if logical blend operations or advanced OpenGL blend operations are in use.

Zero:		Blend factor is (0, 0, 0, 0).
One:		Blend factor is (1, 1, 1, 1).
DstColor:		Blend factor is (Rd, Gd, Bd, Ad).
SrcColor:		Blend factor is (Rs, Gs, Bs, As).
OneMinusDstColor:	Blend factor is (1 - Rd, 1 - Gd, 1 - Bd, 1 - Ad).
SrcAlpha:		Blend factor is (As, As, As, As).
OneMinusSrcColor:	Blend factor is (1 - Rs, 1 - Gs, 1 - Bs, 1 - As).
DstAlpha:		Blend factor is (Ad, Ad, Ad, Ad).
OneMinusDstAlpha:	Blend factor is (1 - Ad, 1 - Ad, 1 - Ad, 1 - Ad).
SrcAlphaSaturate:	Blend factor is (f, f, f, 1); where f = min(As, 1 - Ad).
OneMinusSrcAlpha:	Blend factor is (1 - As, 1 - As, 1 - As, 1 - As).
