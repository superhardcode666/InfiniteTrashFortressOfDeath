Hello and thanks for purchasing Distortinator! 

I really, really appretiate it! :3

----------------------------

How to use:

To use Distortionator is quite simple.

1 - Just create a new material under Assets > Create > Shader
2 - Name and select new material
3 - As the material's shader, select Custom/FunkyBackground
4 - Assign material to a Sprite Renderer's Material
5 - Adjust parameters as needed!

However, there are a couple of things to note:
- For best performance, textures' Wrap Mode should be NOT Clamp. Use insted Repeat/Mirror (or variations) according with your necessities.
- The shader should work with all three Draw Modes: Default, Sliced and Tiled, though I mostly tested on Default and Tiled.
- Quite a bit can be done with the Blend Modes. For the most common combinations of Blend Modes, read "Blend Types.txt", included with this package.
